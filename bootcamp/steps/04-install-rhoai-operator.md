## 4. Install RHOAI operator and components

Before you install RHOAI, it is important to understand how it's dependencies will be managed as it be automated or not. Below are required and **use-case dependent operators**:

| Operator                                        | Description                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`Red Hat OpenShift Serverless Operator`          | if RHOAI KServe is planned for serving, this is required              |
|`Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator`        | if RHOAI KServe is planned for serving, this is required              |
|`Red Hat Authorino Operator`                     | if you want to authenticate KServe model API endpoints with a route   |
|`Red Hat Node Feature Discovery (NFD) Operator`  | if additional hardware features are being utilized, like GPU          |
|`NVIDIA GPU Operator`                            | if NVIDIA GPU accelerators exist                                      |
|`NVIDIA Network Operator`                        | if NVIDIA Infiniband accelerators exist                               |
|`Kernel Module Management (KMM) Operator`        | if Intel Gaudi/AMD accelerators exist                                 |
|`HabanaAI Operator`                              | if Intel Gaudi accelerators exist                                     |
|`AMD GPU Operator`                               | if AMD accelerators exist                                             |

>NOTE: `NFD` and `KMM` operators exists with other patterns, these are the most common.

#### RHOAI Component States

There are 3x RHOAI Operator dependency states to be set: `Managed`, `Removed`, and `Unmanaged`.

| State      |   Description                                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`Managed`   |The RHOAI Operator manages the dependency (i.e. `Service Mesh`, `Serverless`, etc.). RHOAI manages the operands, not the operators. This is where `FeatureTrackers` come into play.|
|`Removed`   | The RHOAI Operator removes the dependency. Changing from `Managed` to `Removed` does remove the dependency|
|`Unmanaged` | The RHAOI Operator does not manage the dependency allowing for an administrator to manage it instead.  Changing from `Managed` to `Unmanaged` does not remove the dependency. For example, this is important when the customer has an existing Service Mesh. It won't create it when it doesn't exist, but you can make manual changes.|

### Steps (RHOAI Operator)

- Check the pre-requisite operators in order to fully deploy RHOAI components.
    - ```sh
        oc get subscriptions -A
        ```
         ```sh
        # expected output
        NAMESPACE              NAME                                                                PACKAGE                 SOURCE             CHANNEL
        openshift-operators    authorino-operator                                                  authorino-operator      redhat-operators   tech-preview-v1
        openshift-operators    devworkspace-operator-fast-redhat-operators-openshift-marketplace   devworkspace-operator   redhat-operators   fast
        openshift-operators    servicemeshoperator                                                 servicemeshoperator     redhat-operators   stable
        openshift-operators    web-terminal                                                        web-terminal            redhat-operators   fast
        openshift-serverless   serverless-operator                                                 serverless-operator     redhat-operators   stable
        ```

- Create the namespace in your RHOCP cluster

    - ```sh
        oc create -f configs/rhoai-operator-ns.yaml
        ```

        ```sh
        # expected output
        namespace/redhat-ods-operator created
        ```
- Create the OperatorGroup object

    - ```sh
        oc create -f configs/rhoai-operator-group.yaml
        ```

        ```sh
        # expected output
        operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/rhods-operator created
        ```

>Understanding `update channels`. We are using `stable` channel as this gives customers access to the stable product features. `fast` can lead to an inconsistent experience as it is only supported for 1 month and it updated every month. [More Info](https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhoai-supported-configs).

- Create the Subscription object

    - ```sh
        oc create -f configs/rhoai-operator-subscription.yaml
        ```

        ```sh
        # expected output
        subscription.operators.coreos.com/rhods-operator created
        ```

- Verify at least these projects are created `redhat-ods-applications|redhat-ods-monitoring|redhat-ods-operator`

    - ```sh
        oc get projects -w | grep -E "redhat-ods|rhods"
        ```
    
        ```sh
        # expected output
        redhat-ods-applications                                                           Active
        redhat-ods-applications-auth-provider                                             Active
        redhat-ods-monitoring                                                             Active
        redhat-ods-operator                                                               Active
        ```

When you install the RHOAI Operator in the OpenShift cluster, the following new projects are created:

1. `redhat-ods-operator` contains the RHOAI Operator.
1. `redhat-ods-applications` installs the dashboard and other required components of OpenShift AI.
1. `redhat-ods-monitoring` contains services for monitoring.

Note:
- `rhods-notebooks` is where an individual user notebook environments are deployed by default.
- You or your data scientists must create additional projects for the applications that will use your machine learning models.

>IMPORTANT
Do not install independent software vendor (ISV) applications in namespaces associated with OpenShift AI.

The RHOAI Operator is installed with a `default-dsci` object with the following. Notice how the `serviceMesh` is `Managed`. By default, RHOAI is managing `ServiceMesh`.

- Verify `default-dsci` yaml file
    - ```sh
        oc describe DSCInitialization -n redhat-ods-operator
        ```

        ```yaml
        # expected output
        ...
        apiVersion: dscinitialization.opendatahub.io/v1
        kind: DSCInitialization
        metadata:
        finalizers:
            - dscinitialization.opendatahub.io/finalizer
        name: default-dsci
        spec:
        applicationsNamespace: redhat-ods-applications
        monitoring:
            managementState: Managed
            namespace: redhat-ods-monitoring
        serviceMesh:
            auth:
            audiences:
                - 'https://kubernetes.default'
            controlPlane:
            metricsCollection: Istio
            name: data-science-smcp
            namespace: istio-system
            managementState: Managed
        trustedCABundle:
            customCABundle: ''
            managementState: Managed
        ...
        ```

### Steps (RHOAI Components)

In order to use the RHOAI Operator, you must create a DataScienceCluster instance.
>When you manually installed KServe, you set the value of the managementState to `Unmanaged` within the Kserve component in the DataScienceCluster and MUST update the DSCInitialization object.  
> For `Unmanaged` dependencies, see the Install and managing RHOAI components on the _APPENDIX.md.

- Create the DSC object

    - ```sh
        oc create -f configs/rhoai-operator-dsc.yaml
        ```

        ```sh
        # expected output

        datasciencecluster.datasciencecluster.opendatahub.io/default-dsc created
        ```

- Verify DSC object creation

    - ```sh
        oc get DSCInitialization,FeatureTracker -n redhat-ods-operator
        ```

        ```sh
        # expected output
        NAME                                                              AGE   PHASE   CREATED AT
