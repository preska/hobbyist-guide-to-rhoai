## 1. Add administrative user

Only users with cluster administrator privileges can install and configure RHOAI.

You may be logged into the cluster as user `kubeadmin`, which is an automatically generated temporary user that should not be used as a best practice. See _APPENDIX.md for more details on best practices and patching if needed.

For this procedure, we are using HTpasswd as the Identity Provider (IdP). HTPasswd updates the files that store usernames and password for authentication of HTTP users. RHOAI uses the same IdP as RHOCP, such as: htpasswd, keystone, LDAP, basic-authentication, request-header, GitHub, GitLab, Google, OpenID Connect. [More info](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.15/html/authentication_and_authorization/understanding-identity-provider#supported-identity-providers).

### Steps

- Create an htpasswd file to store the user and password information

    - ```sh
        htpasswd -c -B -b scratch/users.htpasswd <username> <password>
        ```
         ```sh
        # Expected output
        Adding password for user <username>
        ```

- Create a secret to represent the htpasswd file

    - ```sh
        oc create secret generic htpasswd-secret --from-file=htpasswd=scratch/users.htpasswd -n openshift-config
        ```

         ```sh
        # expected output
        secret/htpasswd-secret created
        ```

- Verify you created a secret/htpasswd-secret object in openshift-config project

    - ```sh
        oc get secret/htpasswd-secret -n openshift-config
        ```
         ```sh
        # expected output
        NAME              TYPE     DATA   AGE
        htpasswd-secret   Opaque   1      4m46s
        ```

- Apply the resource to the default OAuth configuration to add the identity provider

    - ```sh
        oc apply -f configs/htpasswd-cr.yaml
        ```
         ```sh
        # expected output
        oauth.config.openshift.io/cluster configured
        ```

- Verify the identity provider

    - ```sh
        oc get oauth/cluster -o yaml
        ```

- Watch for the cluster operator to cycle

    - ```sh
        oc get co authentication -w
        ```

         ```sh
        Wait until you see the co refresh to `0s`
        
        # expected output
        NAME             VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   DEGRADED   SINCE   MESSAGE
        authentication   4.16.6    True        False         False      0s  
        ```
- As kubeadmin, assign the cluster-admin role to perform administrator level tasks

    - ```sh
        oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin1
        ```

         ```sh
        # expected output
        clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cluster-admin added: "<username>"
        ```

- Log in to the cluster as a user from your identity provider, entering the password when prompted. 

  > NOTE: You may need to add the parameter `--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true` if your clusters api endpoint does not have a trusted cert.

  - ```sh
    oc cluster-info 
    ```
  - ```sh
    oc login https://api.cluster-<id>.<id>.sandbox.opentlc.com:6443 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u <username> -p <password>
    ```

> NOTE: The remainder of the procedure should be completed with the new cluster-admin `<username>`.
